        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application.
        </p>
        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p> The web application will provide users with access to information about different
            movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
